        The HSV model is equivalent to the RGB model in such a way that any color in the RGB space can be expressed in terms of HSV values and vice versa. However, this model is often more intuitive and easier to use, epsecially for creative and artistic purposes. In the case of the RGB model, it is easy to remember basic colors, but it is difficult to change e.g. blue to orange. In the RGB color space it is often difficult to go from one color to another. The HSV color model is more convenient, because the parameters resemble the way people think about color more intuitively.

        The H value represents hue, or "type" of color â€“ e.g. blue, yellow or pink. The S value determines saturation, or more formally the chromaticity of color. For instance, a specific hue can be more saturated, which makes it more vivid, or less saturated, which makes it more gray. For saturation values of 0, perfect gray is obtained, irrespective of the hue (H value). The value of V is simply the intensity of color, from darkest (i.e. black) to most intense. HSV is an additive color model, and V represents the amount of light in the color. V is sometimes called brightness, and HSV is also called HSB (this is exactly the same model).
